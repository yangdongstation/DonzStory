All of this may have to start from kindergarten. One day, it should be a holiday or some activity, and only a few children went to kindergarten. If my memory is correct, they are all girls. Then, I naturally meet They played together, everything, and from that moment on, before the awakening of gender consciousness, I knew that I belonged to them.

However, when I was in elementary school, in the first and second grades, my interpersonal skills were not that strong (actually, the real interpersonal communication is to enter a junior high school where I didn't know a classmate), so I made my first friend. The time is probably the second half of the first grade. She is a very lively and cheerful girl. To this day, I can still contact her, but everything has not been smooth sailing. This friendship has faced several near-breaks, but well, plastic sisterhood, it's nothing.

Later, when the gender consciousness awakened, my identification with me was, of course, female. From that day on, I was destined to be a performer in my own home and school. After all, once this kind of thing is discovered, it is likely to become a tragedy (what happened later also verified my statement).

Looking back, deceiving family members and friends is probably the last thing I want to do, and it is also the most difficult, and I have faced the edge of the cabinet and the cabinet a few times. Pretend to be a stranger you don't know or understand. Trust me, this is definitely not a taste. Who doesn't want to be coquettish to the parents, at least, when I was cute before, I had the capital to go to the parents to be coquettish. But I hardly did that to my parents in order not to turn myself into a tragedy.

Well, since elementary school I've been pretending to be someone I don't know, don't understand, and don't want to be. I really envy them, and, if there is a choice, I believe that no one chooses to be transgender. This road is paved with tears and abuse.

Of course, I also doubted myself when I was in elementary school, mainly because I had feelings for a girl next to me, so I began to doubt myself, and later, I found out that I was just a lily, and this problem was easily solved. . But I really doubted myself at the time.

When I was about to graduate from elementary school, I made my first decision to eat Progynova, but well...actually, it was useless. After learning that I might be sexually precocious, I gave up.

In junior high school, although the interpersonal skills have improved, but also, due to interest reasons, there are no close friends.

However, I did try hormone drugs several times in junior high school, but in the end, I was forced to stop because of economic and physical reasons, or because my parents found out. The amazing thing is that when I use Androcur and Progynova, I have severe pain in the lower abdomen and chest, which can cause me unable to sleep.

In high school, maybe my deskmate smelled friendly in me, so I was pulled into her social circle.

I think a big turning point for me happened during the third grade online class, when I got Androcur again. How should I put it, this time should be in the middle of adolescence, although it was only a short ten days, but I felt a sense of surprise. Kind of, relieved, I have never had that before (maybe it was before puberty, so there was no hormonal change), that is my own feeling, this kind of feeling has appeared more frequently in mine for a while, but , that's ten days. I admit that there are significant risks associated with casual use of prescription hormonal drugs. And the commonly used doses circulated at that time were also very different, from 12.5-100mg of Androcur seems to be used. Apparently I'm using the minimum 12.5/day. However, there were many people who persuaded me to quit the circle at that time, but because of my determination, I did not quit. I finally stopped the drug because my parents found out. Then, I went to Anding Hospital, where I took psychotropic drugs for my parents for two years.

The second turning point is June 16 this year (2022). From June 16 to mid-July this year, I am full of sugar, and I can clearly perceive that familiar comfort, and anxiety does have Weakened a lot, so the final exam is also ideal.
